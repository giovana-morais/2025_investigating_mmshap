hello :) your python: /ext3/miniconda3/envs/py310/bin/python
Python 3.10.18
The tokenizer class you load from this checkpoint is not the same type as the class this function is called from. It may result in unexpected tokenization. 
The tokenizer class you load from this checkpoint is 'QWenTokenizer'. 
The class this function is called from is 'CustomQwenTokenizer'.
The model is automatically converting to bf16 for faster inference. If you want to disable the automatic precision, please manually add bf16/fp16/fp32=True to "AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained".
Try importing flash-attention for faster inference...
